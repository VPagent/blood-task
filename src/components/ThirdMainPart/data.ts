                BP dropped into the “green” range. 120/60 has been something I
                have been unable to achieve in years on various BP meds. Now I
                achieve numbers like that regularly. I do not yet know what
                combination of meds and supplements will be the final solution
                though I have no doubt this will be an important part of it.
                Thank you!"`,
